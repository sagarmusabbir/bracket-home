Never ever modify files in src/app/(payload) directory
When i ask you something just to discuss dont start changing things and all.
Always tell me whats your plan what you are going to do then take my consent and then do it.
After every unsuccessful operation, if we decided to change our process then dont forget to revert the changes for that unsuccessful operation
Always focus on my command, dont skimm read.
